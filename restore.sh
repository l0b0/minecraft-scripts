# NAME
#    restore.sh - Restore a backup of your Minecraft main directory
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    ./restore.sh
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    Moves the latest ~/.minecraft-<datetime> to ~/.minecraft. If ~/.minecraft
#    already exists, it is backed up first. This way, you can easily switch
#    between two Minecraft installations by subsequent calls to this script.
#
#    If your Minecraft directory for some reason is not in your home directory,
#    then modify minecraft_home in minecraft-scripts.conf.
