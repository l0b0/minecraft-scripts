# NAME
#    install-mod.sh - Install mod from URL
#
# SYNOPSIS
#    ./install-mod.sh URL|PATH [ARCHIVE_DIR] [RESOURCES_DIR]
#
# DESCRIPTION
#    Downloads URL (zip archive) and merges the contents with minecraft.jar and
#    the resources directory. Specify ARCHIVE_DIR / RESOURCES_DIR to include
#    only those directories from the archive into minecraft.jar (default all
#    files) / resources (default nothing).
#
#    If your Minecraft directory for some reason is not in your home directory,
#    then modify "home" in minecraft-scripts.conf.
